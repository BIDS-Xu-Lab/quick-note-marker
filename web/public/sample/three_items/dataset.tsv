12347712	Data:\n\nPatient: 48-year-old female presents with a new lump in the right breast, discovered during self-exam six weeks ago. Reports gradual enlargement and occasional tenderness, denies nipple discharge or systemic symptoms. Past medical history includes hypertension, controlled with lisinopril; no prior malignancies. Family history significant for maternal breast cancer at age 55.\n\nOn exam, a 2.6 cm firm irregular mass is palpated at the 10 o’clock position of the right breast with mild overlying skin puckering. Right axilla shows a single mobile enlarged lymph node. Contralateral breast and systemic exam unremarkable.\n\nDiagnostic workup: Mammogram and ultrasound demonstrate a suspicious irregular lesion, BI-RADS 5. Core biopsy confirms invasive ductal carcinoma, grade II, ER 90% positive, PR 20% positive, HER2 negative, Ki-67 22%. MRI shows no multifocal disease; CT chest/abdomen/pelvis reveals no distant metastasis.\n\nAssessment: Newly diagnosed invasive ductal carcinoma, right breast, clinical stage IIB (cT2N1M0), hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative.\n\nPlan: Refer to surgical oncology for discussion of lumpectomy versus mastectomy with axillary staging. Send tissue for Oncotype DX testing to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decision. Initiate endocrine therapy following surgery. Anticipate radiation post-lumpectomy. Provide referral for genetic counseling and psychosocial support services. Follow-up after tumor board discussion.			yes	2025-2-13 22:20:38
